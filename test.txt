                                       ***QUESTION PAPER***

1)	A python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’ is named and used as in python programs.                                    	a)SciPy						b)Pandas				c)NumPy						d)pyplot
2)	To generate a NumPy array from given limits and number of elements required, _________ method is used.				a) numpy.array()			b)numpy.linspace()			c)numpy.arange()			d)numpy.ndarray()
3)	array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10],									  [12, 14, 16, 18, 20],								  [22, 24, 26, 28, 30],								  [32, 34, 36, 38, 40] )							
Ary[3, : :,-1] would yield								a) [32, 34, 36, 38, 40]								b) [40, 38, 36, 34, 32]								c) [22, 24, 26, 28, 30]								d) [30, 28, 26, 24, 22]
4)	Write statements for the following:

i) Create a Numpy array storing random integer in the range (0..5] and having 10 elements in it.

ii) Create a 2 dimensional NumPy array storing random integers in the range (25..35] and having dimensions as 4x3.

iii) Create a Numpy array storing floating point numbers in the range (0..1] and having dimensions as 3x2.

iv) Create a Numpy array storing floating point numbers in the range (0..1] and having dimensions as 4x5.
5)	Given an ndarray x as given below:

>>>x=np.arange(10)
print(x)

array([ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ])

Write statements to extract an array slice:

i) from start to 4th position
ii) from 4th to 6th position
iii) from 4th position to end
iv)  having elements at each even           	place in the ndarray		
v)    having elements from first 		position, step by 2		
vi)   having reversed elements of 		the array
6)	What will be the output of the following:

i) grid = np.array( [ [1, 2, 3,], 					[4, 5, 6,] ]) 	
     np.concatenate( [grid, grid] )
ii) np.concatenate( [grid, grid],  	axis=1)
